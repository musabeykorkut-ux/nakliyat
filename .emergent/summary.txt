<analysis>
I have analyzed the trajectory of the conversation with the user. The project began with a comprehensive request to build a multi-page website for a Turkish moving company, Baraj Nakliyat, using Next.js and Supabase. After initial clarifications, I proceeded to build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). The user provided highly critical feedback, stating that the MVP was incomplete and non-functional in many key areas, such as the admin panel's CRUD operations, content management for the homepage, dynamic menus, and image uploads.

My response to this feedback was to begin a large-scale revision. I updated the backend API () with numerous new endpoints for gallery, SEO, and homepage management. I also created new pages in the admin panel to manage this new content and updated the  file accordingly to include the necessary database tables.

The most recent activity involved starting to modify the admin services page () to implement the requested image upload and advanced SEO features. The user interrupted, questioning the pause, and I confirmed that I was continuing with the implementation.

The user's primary language is Turkish. The next agent must respond in Turkish.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to build a professional, multi-page, SEO-optimized website for Baraj Nakliyat, a Turkish moving company.

**Core Features:**
-   **Frontend:** A responsive, fast, and modern website built with Next.js, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS, featuring a blue and yellow corporate theme. Key pages include Home, Services (list/detail), Blog (list/detail), About, Contact, Quote Request, and Gallery.
-   **Content:** All UI and content must be in Turkish.
-   **Admin Panel:** A secure, comprehensive backend panel for full Content Management System (CMS) capabilities. The admin must be able to perform CRUD operations for:
    -   Services, Blog Posts, Testimonials, FAQs, Gallery Images.
    -   Manage homepage content directly (sliders, CTAs, testimonials).
    -   View and manage contact form submissions and quote requests.
    -   Manage global SEO settings (meta titles/descriptions, canonicals, OG images) for all pages.
-   **Integrations:**
    -   **Supabase:** For the PostgreSQL database and image storage (in a bucket named ).
    -   **Resend:** For sending email notifications from contact/quote forms to a specified email address.
    -   **Image Upload:** All content types (services, blogs, gallery) must support image uploads from the admin panel to Supabase Storage.
-   **User Feedback Driven Features:** The user explicitly rejected a basic MVP and demanded a fully functional admin panel where all site content is editable, menus are dynamic, and SEO is manageable on a per-page basis.
</product_requirements>
<key_technical_concepts>
- **Framework/Libraries:** Next.js 14 (App Router), React 18, TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui.
- **Backend:** Next.js API Routes, handling all backend logic in a single monolithic route file ().
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL) for data and Supabase Storage for file uploads.
- **Forms:** React Hook Form and Zod for validation.
- **Email:** Resend integration for transactional emails.
- **Language:** TypeScript.
</key_technical_concepts>
<code_architecture>
The project is a standard Next.js 14 App Router application. Backend logic is centralized in a single dynamic API route file that handles various endpoints based on the URL path. State management is primarily done within React components using  and .

**Directory Structure:**


-   ****
    -   **Importance:** This is the single most critical backend file. It acts as a monolithic API router, handling all GET, POST, PATCH, and DELETE requests for services, blog posts, testimonials, gallery, SEO settings, and homepage content.
    -   **Changes:** It has been extensively modified from its initial version to include dozens of new endpoints to support the full-featured admin panel requested by the user, including logic for admin-specific CRUD operations.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** Defines the entire database structure. It's the source of truth for all tables, columns, and relationships in the Supabase PostgreSQL database.
    -   **Changes:** Initially created with basic tables, it was later updated to include new tables like , , and  to support the expanded feature set requested by the user.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** This directory contains all pages for the administrative panel. It's where the user will manage all website content.
    -   **Changes:** New pages were created (, , ) to provide the management interfaces for the new features. The main admin dashboard () and layout () were updated to reflect these additions.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** This is the admin page for managing Services. The user's feedback requires it to have advanced functionality.
    -   **Changes:** Work was in progress to add state and form handling for image uploads and detailed SEO fields (meta title, description, OG image), directly addressing user complaints.
</code_architecture>
<pending_tasks>
- Complete the implementation of image uploads for services, blog posts, and gallery items from the admin panel to Supabase Storage.
- Implement the email notification system using Resend (requires user to provide an API key).
- Make the main navigation menu a dynamic dropdown populated from the 'Services' table.
- Ensure the admin panel is fully functional, allowing all content (including homepage sections like tabs, testimonials, CTAs) to be created, read, updated, and deleted.
- Implement the dedicated SEO Ayarları page to manage metadata for all site pages.
- Add logo and favicon upload functionality.

<current_work>
Following extensive and critical feedback from the user that the initial MVP was insufficient, I have pivoted to a large-scale implementation of a full-featured CMS. The user was unhappy that the admin panel was non-functional and that key features like image uploads, a gallery, and detailed content/SEO management were missing.

To address this, I have:
1.  **Expanded the API:** Significantly updated  to include numerous new admin-only endpoints for managing a gallery, homepage content, and site-wide SEO settings.
2.  **Updated the Database Schema:** Modified  to include new tables (, , ) required for these features.
3.  **Created New Admin Pages:** Added new files under  for , , and  to provide UIs for the new functionality.
4.  **Began UI Implementation:** The immediate task I was working on was updating the Hizmetler management page at . The goal was to add the form fields and logic for handling image uploads and the per-page SEO settings (meta title, description, etc.), as this was a major point of criticism from the user. This work was interrupted by the user asking why progress had stopped.

<optional_next_step>
Continue editing  to fully implement the image upload functionality and advanced SEO fields, then test the create/update flow for a service item to ensure it works as requested.
